TUD "Campus" Sequence

This dataset was used to compare pedestrian detectors in the paper:

M. Andriluka, S. Roth, B. Schiele. People-Tracking-by-Detection and
People-Detection-by-Tracking. IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and
Pattern Recognition (CVPR'08), Anchorage, USA, June 2008.

The dataset contains 71 image with 303 annotated pedestrians. All
pedestrians are in side-view and many are partially occluding each
other.

Annotation is provided in the file tud-campus-sequence.idl. Each line
in the file contains name of the image followed by the list of
annotation rectangles in the [xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax] format.  All
pedestrians visible to at least 50% were annotated.
