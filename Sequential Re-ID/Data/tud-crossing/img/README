TUD "Crossing" Sequence

This dataset was used to demonstrate tracking by detection results in
the paper:

M. Andriluka, S. Roth, B. Schiele. People-Tracking-by-Detection and
People-Detection-by-Tracking. IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and
Pattern Recognition (CVPR'08), Anchorage, USA, June 2008.

The dataset contains 201 images with 1008 annotated pedestrians. Most
of the pedestians are in side-view and many are partially occluded for the
whole sequence.

Annotation is provided in the file tud-crossing-sequence.idl. Each line
in the file contains name of the image followed by the list of
annotation rectangles in the [xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax] format.  All
pedestrians visible to at least 50% were annotated.
